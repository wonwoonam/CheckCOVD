# CheckCOVID
This is a personal project that I did, which used Korean Government's open API, to visually show the distribution of people who tested positive for COVID.

# Motive
The already-existing COVID apps had very low user-friendly UI/UX, and so I decided to make my own version of it to help Korean citizens which area to avoid, and prevent
themselves from getting COVID.

# Process
Although this project didn't make it to the app store. I spent about two weeks building this app. I coded in Swift and designed UI/UX in Adobe XD.
